# Linear_Regression_ML_Bike_Sharing
ML-I assignment 
Building a Machine learning model for preding the demand of shared bikes offered by a bike sharing company. The obective is to develope a predective ML model based on previous available data set for projecting the demand in future As the historical data set is available to traint he model it is a "Supervised Learning" ML problem. The data set are continous hence a "Linear Regression" Machine Learnig model is being developed
